## Application Server Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- Web Server
- Server
- Web stack debugging

My web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that I installed in my first web stack project. While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project I will add this piece to my infrastructure, plug it to Nginx and make it serve the Airbnb clone project.
